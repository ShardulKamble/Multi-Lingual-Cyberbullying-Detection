# **Multi-Lingual-Cyberbullying-Detection**

Multi-lingual cyberbullying detection refers to the process of using technology, often powered by natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, to identify and mitigate instances of cyberbullying across multiple languages. Cyberbullying involves the use of digital communication platforms to harass, threaten, or harm individuals. Given the global nature of the internet, cyberbullying can occur in various languages and across different cultures.

In this project, I have mainly focussed on identifying agression levels like Covertly, Overtly and Non-Aggressive as Task 1. I have also predicted Mysogyny levels as Task 2.

For this project, I have used Hindi and Bengali Dataset containing social media content. 

**XLM-RoBERTa Model**

XLM-RoBERTa is a specific model that combines aspects of both cross-lingual language models (XLM) and the RoBERTa architecture. It is designed to handle multilingual and cross-lingual natural language processing tasks. Here's a brief overview of the XLM-RoBERTa model:

Cross-Lingual Language Models (XLM): XLM is a type of language model that is trained on multiple languages to understand and generate text in different languages. It aims to capture language-agnostic representations by pretraining on a diverse range of languages. This enables the model to generalize well across various languages, even for languages with limited training data.

RoBERTa Architecture: The RoBERTa architecture is an evolution of the original BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. It focuses on optimizing the pretraining process by using larger batch sizes, more training data, and longer training times. This leads to improved language understanding and representation capabilities.

Combining XLM and RoBERTa: XLM-RoBERTa is the result of applying the RoBERTa architecture to the cross-lingual context of XLM. It pretrains on a wide range of languages, capturing their linguistic nuances and patterns. This allows the model to understand and generate text in multiple languages, making it particularly useful for tasks that involve multiple languages or require cross-lingual understanding.
